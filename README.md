# Simple-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple tic tac toe game applet that I developed and requires the following modifications:
  1.Needs to implement it in a stand-alone window rather than an applet.
  2.Needs to implement AI based single player mode.
  3.Requires much more proper and precise documentation.
  
To run this you must have an applet viewer(It comes by default with all jdk2 onwards).
compile the .java file and use 
>>appletviewer App.html
to run this.
